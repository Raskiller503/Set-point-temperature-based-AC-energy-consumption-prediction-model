# Set-point-temperature-based-HVAC-energy-consumption-prediction-model

HVAC energy consumption constitutes a significant portion of total building energy usage.  \
In particular, changes in the set-point temperature have a substantial impact on energy consumption.  \
Understanding how energy consumption varies with a 1Â°C increase or decrease in the set-point temperature is crucial for optimizing energy efficiency.

## Influence of diffenerent parameters.
